## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

<Input
className={
editEmail && !isValidEmail ? "error-message-input" : ""
}
label="Email address"
id="email"
name="email"
placeholder="<email@company.com>"
required
type="email"
value={email}
onChange={handleEmailChange}
/>

- Using the ternary operator in className was helpful in understanding how to apply logic to css class properties in react.

### Continued development

- Testing React Apps (unit test)
- Handling Error Message in React

### Useful resources
